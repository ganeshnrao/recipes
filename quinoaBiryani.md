# Quinoa Hail Seitan
This is inspired by hyderabadi biryani. This can be easily made into a biryani by replacing the quinoa with long-grain white basmati rice and the setian with Upton's Chicken, and the spices with garam masala, and chicken tikka seasoning.

### Prepare the quinoa

- [ ] Stop the heat on the pot

- [ ] Seal the lid, and set time on pot for 4 min
- [ ] When done, let off the steam, open the pot, add zucchini, green peas, and carrots, and seal lid and set the timer on the instant pot for 1 minute.
- [ ] Set another timer (on your phone) for 4 minutes, when the timer on your phone goes off, turn off the instant pot and let off steam. We do this so that the vegetables don't get mushy.
